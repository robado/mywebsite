<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am a software engineer with a passion for coding and technology. In my free time, I enjoy outdoor activities such as biking and going for walks, as well as staying active by going to the gym. I also have a love for music and enjoy playing musical instruments.</p>

<h2>What I Want to Do on My Website</h2>
<p>On my website, I want to showcase my coding projects and share my experiences and learnings. Additionally, I plan to document my journey of learning how to solve Sudoku puzzles, list the books I have read, share the shows and anime I have watched, and discuss the games I have played.</p>
